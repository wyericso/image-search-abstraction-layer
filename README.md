Image Search Abstraction Layer
=========================

**Objective**: Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this: [https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10](https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10) and browse recent search queries like this: [https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/](https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/). Then deploy it to Glitch.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit [https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects).

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story**: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.

**User Story**: I can paginate through the responses by adding a `?offset=2` parameter to the URL.

**User Story**: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
